# Alien Invasion Game
# Overview
Welcome to the Alien Invasion game! This project is a Python-based arcade shooter inspired by the classic Space Invaders game. Developed using the Pygame library, Alien Invasion challenges players to defend their spaceship against waves of alien invaders. This project demonstrates skills in game development, object-oriented programming, and graphical user interface creation.

# Features
Player Control: Navigate your spaceship using the arrow keys and fire bullets with the spacebar.

Alien Fleet: Face off against a fleet of aliens that move across and down the screen.

Increasing Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as you progress, with aliens moving faster and appearing in greater numbers.
