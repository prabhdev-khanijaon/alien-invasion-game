- Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen, with appropriate 
spacing around it.

- Fill the upper portion of the screen with as many aliens as I can fit 
horizontally. I'll then create additional rows of aliens until I have a full 
fleet.

- Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet is shot down, 
an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the ground. If the entire fleet is 
shot down, I'll create a new fleet. If an alien hits the ship or the ground, 
I'll destroy the ship and create a new fleet.

- Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game when the 
player has used up the allotted number of ships.
