Project Plan Phase 3 - Expanding The Game

Make aliens jitter-pause for a couple seconds, then shoot down at high speed.
Progressively more difficult at each level,
2 aliens at level 1, 4 at level 2 and so on.
Use the random module to randomize the alien that will shoot down.
The rest of the behavior will be the same.

What do I require?
Make a second alien pygame.sprite.Group() for the high speed aliens in
[alien_invasion].
Remove the randomized aliens from the original group and add them to the
second group.
Apply the new behavior to the aliens in the second group in [alien].
The rest of the behaviors should remain the same.
Add a behavior in [settings] so that each time the player progresses to a new
level, another 2 aliens will turn into high speed aliens.
